### My favorite projects

- As a group, made a simple non-fungible token (NFT) game where users battle their NFT's against each other. Implemented using Solidity, Javascript, and React.js. I was mostly responsible for the Solidity code.
- Implemented a B-Tree structure to hold DNA sequences for fast pattern searching and a search method for minimal disk i/o using Java.
